# Beijing-Air-Quality-Prediction
## Task Description
Predict concentration levels of several pollutants over the coming 24*2 hours (two days) for 35 stations in Beijing, China.   
Use air quality data and meteorological(weather) data from January 2017 to April 30 (including), 2018 to predict the pollution level of PM2.5, PM10, O3 between May 1 to May 2, 2018 (once an hour, 48 times for one station in total).
## Task Description
1. Air Quality Data (on hourly basis)
The Air Quality Data file contains the concentration of PM2.5 (ug/m3), PM10 (ug/m3), NO2 (ug/m3), CO (mg/m3), O3 (ug/m3) and SO2 (ug/m3) from Beijing. 
Need to predict the concentration of PM2.5, PM10 and O3.
